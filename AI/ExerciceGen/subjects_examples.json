Therefore, the expression becomes:\n\\[ \\frac{(x + 2)^2}{\\sqrt{(x + 2)^2} + x} \\]\n\nSince $\\sqrt{(x + 2)^2} = |x + 2|$, we have:\n\\[ \\frac{(x + 2)^2}{|x + 2| + x} \\]\n\nWe are given that $x \\geq -2$, which means $x + 2 \\geq 0$. Hence, $|x + 2| = x + 2$. So, the expression simplifies to:\n\\[ \\frac{(x + 2)^2}{x + 2 + x} = \\frac{(x + 2)^2}{2x + 2} \\]\n\nTo find the maximum value, let's simplify further:\n\\[ \\frac{(x + 2)^2}{2(x + 1)} \\]\n\nThis can be rewritten as:\n\\[ \\frac{x + 2}{2} \\cdot \\frac{x + 2}{x + 1} \\]\n\nLet $y = \\frac{x + 2}{x + 1}$. Then, $x + 2 = y(x + 1) = xy + y$, which implies $x = \\frac{y - 2}{y - 1}$.\n\nSubstituting this back into the expression, we get:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot y \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the maximum value of $y = \\frac{x + 2}{x + 1}$.\n\nNotice that $y$ is a decreasing function of $x$ for $x \\geq -2$. Therefore, to maximize $y$, we need to minimize $x$.\n\nSince $x \\geq -2$, the minimum value of $x$ is $-2$. However, substituting $x = -2$ would make the denominator of $y$ zero.\n\nSo, we consider the limit as $x$ approaches $-2$ from the right:\n\\[ \\lim_{x \\to -2^+} \\frac{x + 2}{x + 1} = \\lim_{x \\to -2^+} \\frac{0}{-1} = 0 \\]\n\nHence, the maximum value of the expression is:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 4 = \\boxed{2} \\]",

Since her great-grandfather is the younger brother, his birth year should be after his brother's birth year.\nThus we should add the gap of 18 years to his brother's birth year of 1914.\nThus, we have 1914 + 18 = 1932.\nSo Emily's great-grandfather was born in \\boxed{1932}.",

Therefore, as $x$ gets larger, the fraction gets smaller.\n\nHowever, we are interested in the minimum value. To find it, let's consider the behavior of the function as $x$ approaches 0, since $x$ is a positive real number.\n\nAs $x$ approaches 0, the expression approaches:\n\\[ \\lim_{x \\to 0} \\frac{x+\\sqrt{1+x^2}}{x^2+1} = \\frac{0+\\sqrt{1+0^2}}{0^2+1} = \\sqrt{1} = 1 \\]\n\nBut since our manipulation involved rationalizing and simplifying, let's ensure we haven't altered the original expression's behavior. Our goal was to understand how the expression changes as $x$ varies, not to find an exact minimum through simplification alone.\n\nGiven the nature of the problem, and realizing the simplification provided insight into the behavior but not a direct path to the minimum, we recognize that the minimum value occurs when the denominator is maximized relative to the numerator. The original expression, due to the square root, does not easily lend itself to traditional optimization techniques like differentiation in its given form without a more complex analysis involving calculus.\n\nHowever, recognizing the oversight in directly applying the simplified form to deduce the minimum, we should approach the problem with calculus for a rigorous solution:\n\nLet $f(x) = \\frac{x + \\sqrt{1+x^2}}{x^2+1}$. To find the minimum, we would typically take the derivative of $f(x)$ with respect to $x$, set it equal to zero, and solve for $x$. However, due to the complexity of the expression and the error in simplification that led to an incorrect method for finding the minimum, we must correct our approach.\n\nCorrect Approach:\n\nThe actual process involves recognizing that the expression given does not easily simplify to a form where the minimum is apparent without calculus. The correct method would involve taking the derivative of the original expression and setting it equal to zero to find critical points, which was not done here.\n\nGiven the error in methodology and the complexity of directly solving for the minimum with the provided steps, the key insight should be that simplification alone does not reveal the minimum, and calculus is needed for an accurate solution.\n\nHowever, the initial problem setup and incorrect simplification attempt suggest a misunderstanding of the problem's requirements for a solution that directly leads to the minimum value through algebraic manipulation alone.\n\nGiven the setup, the correct realization should be that without applying calculus or a more direct optimization technique suited for the given expression, pinpointing the exact minimum value is not straightforward from the simplified expression provided.\n\nTherefore, acknowledging the mistake in the process and the need for a calculus-based solution or a more appropriate optimization technique, the answer provided here does not accurately reflect the solution to the problem as initially presented.\n\nRealizing the mistake and the limitations of the provided steps in achieving the solution, the approach should involve recognizing the necessity of calculus or a similar method to accurately determine the minimum of the given expression.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",

This means that either Actor A or Actor B can be chosen for a main character role, but not both.\n\nNext, Actor C can only play the role of the jester.

Choose the queen: After choosing the king, there are 5 remaining actors to choose from for the queen role. However, if Actor A is chosen as the king, Actor B cannot be chosen as the queen, and vice versa. So, the actual number of options for the queen role depends on the choice of king.\n3. Choose the jester: This role is fixed and can only be played by Actor C.\n4. Choose the narrator: After choosing the king, queen, and jester, there are 4 remaining actors to choose from for the narrator role.\n\nConsidering the constraints and the choices for each role, we can calculate the total number of ways to cast the main characters.\n\nHowever, we also need to assign the remaining 3 actors to smaller roles. Since the order of assignment does not matter, this can be done in one way.\n\nLet's calculate the total number of ways to cast the main characters:\n\n* If Actor A is chosen as the king, there are 4 options for the queen (since Actor B cannot be chosen). Then, Actor C is fixed as the jester, and there are 4 options for the narrator. This gives 1 (choice of king) * 4 (choices of queen) * 1 (choice of jester) * 4 (choices of narrator) = 16 possibilities.\n* If Actor B is chosen as the king, there are 4 options for the queen (since Actor A cannot be chosen). Then, Actor C is fixed as the jester, and there are 4 options for the narrator. This gives 1 (choice of king) * 4 (choices of queen) * 1 (choice of jester) * 4 (choices of narrator) = 16 possibilities.\n* If one of the other actors (E, F, or G) is chosen as the king, there are 5 options for the queen (since neither Actor A nor Actor B is chosen as the king). Then, Actor C is fixed as the jester, and there are 4 options for the narrator. This gives 3 (choices of king) * 5 (choices of queen) * 1 (choice of jester) * 4 (choices of narrator) = 60 possibilities.\n\nAdding these possibilities together, we have a total of 16 + 16 + 60 = 32 + 60 = 92 ways to cast the main characters.\n\nSince the remaining 3 actors can be assigned to smaller roles in one way, the total number of ways to cast the four main characters and assign the remaining actors to smaller roles is 92.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{92} \\]",

                    "response": "## Step 1: Apply the Law of Cosines to find the relationship between the sides of the triangle and the cosine of angle B.\nThe Law of Cosines states that for any triangle with sides of length a, b, and c opposite to angles A, B, and C respectively, c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab * cos(C). Here, we let a = BC, b = AB = 15, and c = AC = 18.\n\n## Step 2: Substitute the known values into the Law of Cosines equation.\n18^2 = BC^2 + 15^2 - 2*BC*15*cos(B).\n\n## Step 3: Simplify the equation.\n324 = BC^2 + 225 - 30*BC*cos(B).\n\n## Step 4: Use the given information that cos(B) = BC/AB to substitute for cos(B) in the equation.\n324 = BC^2 + 225 - 30*BC*(BC/15).\n\n## Step 5: Simplify the equation further.\n324 = BC^2 + 225 - 2*BC^2.\n\n## Step 6: Combine like terms and solve for BC^2.\n324 = -BC^2 + 225.\n\n## Step 7: Move terms around to isolate BC^2.\nBC^2 = 225 - 324.\n\n## Step 8: Perform the subtraction.\nBC^2 = -99.\n\n## Step 9: Recognize that a negative value under the square root is not possible for a length, indicating a mistake in previous steps. Re-evaluate the equation from step 2 and correct it by directly applying the given relationship cos(B) = BC/AB to find BC without needing to apply the Law of Cosines in the same manner.\nGiven that cos(B) = BC/AB, and knowing that AB = 15, we can write BC = 15*cos(B). However, we realize that without directly calculating cos(B) first, we incorrectly applied the formula.\n\n## Step 10: Correctly apply the Law of Cosines to solve for BC.\nFirst, note that angle A = 30 degrees. We should apply the Law of Cosines correctly considering the known angle A and sides AB and AC to find BC.\n\n## Step 11: Correctly apply the Law of Cosines formula considering angle A.\nBC^2 = AB^2 + AC^2 - 2*AB*AC*cos(A).\n\n## Step 12: Substitute the known values into the corrected Law of Cosines equation.\nBC^2 = 15^2 + 18^2 - 2*15*18*cos(30 degrees).\n\n## Step 13: Simplify the equation.\nBC^2 = 225 + 324 - 540*cos(30 degrees).\n\n## Step 14: Calculate cos(30 degrees).\ncos(30 degrees) = sqrt(3)/2.\n\n## Step 15: Substitute the value of cos(30 degrees) into the equation.\nBC^2 = 225 + 324 - 540*sqrt(3)/2.\n\n## Step 16: Simplify the equation.\nBC^2 = 549 - 270*sqrt(3).\n\n## Step 17: Solve for BC by taking the square root of both sides.\nBC = sqrt(549 - 270*sqrt(3)).\n\n## Step 18: Calculate the numerical value of BC.\nAfter calculating, we find that BC is approximately equal to a specific value once the correct arithmetic is applied.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{9}$",
